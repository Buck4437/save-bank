        <h1>Info</h1>

        This save bank is based on earth's <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wkUvOwlFvTMCiTPvAjVNyuaILNRE6zoXms2S8R2RtA8/edit#">save archive</a>
        <br>
        It was created after pastebin started deleting paste of save file (rip save archive),
        <br>
        in order to provided save files for players who lost their save files,
        <br>
        and to store them more securely and permanently.
