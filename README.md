AD Save Bank is a centralized place to store save files for the game "Antimatter Dimensions".

## Preface
This project is based on the [save archive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wkUvOwlFvTMCiTPvAjVNyuaILNRE6zoXms2S8R2RtA8/edit) created by earthernsence.
The save archive operates by uploading save files to Pastebin and storing the links in a document. However, the website started deleting encrypted pastes, including the save files.
To conserve as many save files as possible and retain the save archive's functionality, most of the saves were migrated to the new save bank, which is more long-lasting, interactive and convenient.

## Contributing
This project is still a work in progress. There are a number of ways you can contribute to this project:

### Donating save files
If you wish to donate a save file, you can send me a DM via discord (Buck#4437). I will see if I can find a place for it.

### Coding
